# CONCEPTS

Shared vocabulary for this repo. One canonical term per concept; definitions stay conceptual — no implementation specifics, status, or links.

## Release verification

- **Source inventory** — the enumerable list of items a derived deliverable is authored from (mechanisms distilled into skills, records in a migration, sections in a consolidation).
- **Drop-list** — the explicit, reasoned record of source-inventory items deliberately left out of a deliverable. The only artifact where a silent omission is visible; each entry carries a reason judged by a reviewable rubric.
- **Structural criterion** — a success criterion that measures an artifact's presence or well-formedness (exists, parses, loads, emits an expected line) rather than its content. *Avoid: presence check* as a criterion name — reserve it for describing what the criterion measures.
- **Traceability criterion** — a success criterion requiring every source-inventory item to be either present in the deliverable (with a citation) or on a drop-list with a reason. The fidelity-class complement to structural criteria for inventory-derived work.
- **Content-fidelity drift** — divergence between a source inventory and the content authored from it; invisible to structural criteria by construction.
